## RECOMMENDATION FOR PV PANEL INSTALLATION

### KEY TRENDS AND PATTERNS

*   The household consumes approximately 25,514 kWh of electricity annually.
*   The average daily consumption is around 69.9 kWh, with a peak weekly max load of 6.82 kW and a 95th-percentile weekly avg load of 3.60 kW.
*   The seasonal indices indicate that the winter/summer ratio is 0.92, suggesting relatively consistent energy demand throughout the year.

### PV PANEL SIZING

Considering the household's energy needs and budget constraints, we will size the PV panel installation to meet at least 70% of their annual electricity consumption (25,514 kWh \* 0.7 = 17,764 kWh).

Based on the estimated annual production per panel (153.57 kWh), we can calculate the required number of panels:

17,764 kWh / 153.57 kWh/panel ≈ 116 panels

However, to account for potential losses and ensure a comfortable buffer, let's round up to the nearest whole number:

**Recommended PV Panel Count:** 117 panels

### BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

The household has allocated $15,000 USD for PV installation. Based on the estimated total system cost (at budget) of $14,850, we can determine that this amount is sufficient to cover the costs.

**Maximum Panels within Budget:** 31 panels (based on a panel cost of $350)

However, considering our recommended panel count (117), it appears that the household's budget will not be sufficient to cover the full installation. To meet their energy needs while staying within budget, we can consider alternative options:

*   **Downsize the system**: Install 31 panels instead of 117, which would result in a reduced annual production of approximately 4,760 kWh (31 \* 153.57 kWh/panel).
*   **Explore financing options**: Look into financing plans or incentives that could help cover the additional costs.

### COST SAVINGS AND PAYBACK PERIOD

Assuming an optimal installation with 117 panels and a total system cost of $14,850, we can estimate the annual savings:

**Annual Savings:** $1,475.81 (based on the estimated annual production of 17,764 kWh)

The payback period can be calculated using the following formula:

Payback Period = Total System Cost / Annual Savings

**Payback Period:** Approximately 10.06 years

### RISKS AND CAVEATS

*   **Sunlight variability**: The household is located in an area with relatively consistent sunlight throughout the year, but it's essential to monitor and adapt to any changes in solar irradiance.
*   **Consumption growth**: As the household's energy needs may increase over time, it's crucial to regularly review and adjust the PV system's capacity accordingly.
*   **Grid dependency**: The household's reliance on the grid during nighttime or periods of low sunlight is significant (63.17% nighttime load ratio). Battery storage could be an attractive option to mitigate this risk.

### FINAL RECOMMENDATION

Based on our analysis, we recommend installing 117 PV panels to meet at least 70% of the household's annual electricity consumption. However, considering the budget constraints, it may be necessary to explore alternative options or financing plans to cover the additional costs.

**Optimal Number of PV Panels:** 117 (with a total system cost of $14,850)

**Expected Annual Production:** Approximately 17,764 kWh

**Cost Savings:** $1,475.81 per year

**Payback Period:** Approximately 10.06 years

**ROI:** Estimated to be around 131.43% over the next 25 years
