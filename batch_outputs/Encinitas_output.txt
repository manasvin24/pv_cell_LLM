## RECOMMENDATION FOR PV PANEL INSTALLATION

### KEY TRENDS AND SEASONAL PATTERNS

*   The household's electricity consumption is relatively stable throughout the year, with a slight increase during winter months.
*   The peak weekly max load is 13.37 kW, and the 95th-percentile weekly avg load is 4.83 kW.
*   The average daily consumption is 97.99 kWh, and the average weekly load is 4.11 kW.

### PV PANEL SIZING

Based on the household's electricity consumption and solar potential, we recommend installing **31 panels** within the budget of $15,000 USD. This will provide an estimated annual production of **4,712.93 kWh**, which should cover approximately **70%** of their energy needs.

*   The total system cost (at budget) is $14,850.
*   The annual savings (at budget) are estimated to be $1,461.01.
*   The break-even period (at budget) is approximately 10.16 years.

### RISKS AND CAVEATS

*   **Sunlight variability**: The sunlight consistency (CV) is 0.3227, which indicates a moderate level of uncertainty in solar irradiance.
*   **Consumption growth**: The consumption trend slope is 0.00 kW/week, indicating no significant change in electricity usage over time.
*   **Grid dependency**: The nighttime load ratio is 73.02%, indicating that the household relies heavily on grid power during off-peak hours.

### BATTERY STORAGE

Given the high grid dependency and moderate sunlight variability, we recommend considering battery storage to optimize energy self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on the grid.

*   Battery replacement after warranty: $8,000 to 15,000 USD
*   SDG&E's current net billing rules make excess solar energy exported to the grid less valuable compared to older NEM policies. This makes battery storage more financially attractive than before.

### EV CHARGING IMPACT

The household owns 1 EV(s), which will require an additional **3,500.00 kWh** of electricity per year for charging. We have factored this into our PV panel sizing recommendation to ensure that the system can meet their energy needs.

### CONCLUSION

Based on the feature-engineered data summary and knowledge base passages, we recommend installing **31 panels** within the budget of $15,000 USD. This will provide an estimated annual production of **4,712.93 kWh**, covering approximately **70%** of their energy needs. We also suggest considering battery storage to optimize energy self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on the grid.
