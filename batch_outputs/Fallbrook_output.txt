## RECOMMENDATION FOR PV PANEL INSTALLATION

### KEY TRENDS AND PATTERNS

*   The household consumes approximately 22,950 kWh of electricity annually.
*   The average daily consumption is around 62.88 kWh, with a peak weekly max load of 5.95 kW and a 95th-percentile weekly avg load of 3.24 kW.
*   The seasonal indices indicate that the winter/summer ratio is 0.92, suggesting relatively consistent energy demand throughout the year.

### PV PANEL SIZING

Considering the household's energy needs and budget constraints, we will size the PV panel system to meet at least 70% of their annual electricity consumption.

**Calculations:**

*   Estimated annual production per panel: 157.24 kWh
*   Required number of panels for 100% offset: 146
*   Required number of panels for 70% offset: 103 (rounded up from 102.5)
*   Maximum affordable number of panels within the $15,000 budget: 31 (based on a panel cost of $350 and installation fixed cost of $4,000)

### OPTIMAL NUMBER OF PV PANELS

Given the household's energy needs and budget constraints, we recommend installing **103** PV panels to meet at least 70% of their annual electricity consumption. This will provide approximately **16,511 kWh** of annual production.

### COST SAVINGS AND PAYBACK PERIOD

*   Estimated annual savings: $1,511.08 (based on an average cost per kWh of $0.3100)
*   Break-even period: 9.83 years (based on the estimated annual savings and total system cost)

### RISKS AND CAVEATS

*   Sunlight variability: The household is exposed to relatively high sunlight volatility, with a CV of 0.3322.
*   Consumption growth: The household's energy consumption has been growing at an average rate of 4.1% per year.
*   Grid dependency: The household's nighttime load ratio is 63.17%, indicating significant reliance on the grid during off-peak hours.

### BATTERY STORAGE

Given the household's high sunlight volatility and relatively consistent energy demand throughout the year, battery storage may be advisable to mitigate risks associated with sunlight variability and consumption growth.

**Recommendation:**

Install **103** PV panels to meet at least 70% of the household's annual electricity consumption. This will provide approximately **16,511 kWh** of annual production, resulting in estimated annual savings of $1,511.08 and a break-even period of 9.83 years. Consider installing battery storage to mitigate risks associated with sunlight variability and consumption growth.
