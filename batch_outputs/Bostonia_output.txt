## RECOMMENDATION FOR PV PANEL INSTALLATION

### KEY FINDINGS AND TRENDS

*   The household consumes approximately 31,128 kWh of electricity annually.
*   The average daily consumption is around 85.28 kWh, with a peak weekly max load of 8.16 kW and a 95th-percentile weekly avg load of 4.38 kW.
*   The solar potential summary indicates an average weekly irradiance of 224.05 W/m² and estimated annual sunlight hours of 653.40 hrs.

### PV PANEL SIZING AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

Based on the feature-engineered data, we can estimate the optimal number of PV panels for this household:

*   The recommended system size for 100% offset is 199 panels.
*   Considering the additional charging load from the EV(s), we should aim for a slightly larger system to account for the increased energy demand.

### MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PANELS WITHIN BUDGET

Given the budget of $15,000 USD for PV installation:

*   The estimated cost per panel is around $350.
*   Within this budget, the maximum number of panels that can be installed is approximately 43 (=$15,000 / $350).

### OPTIMAL NUMBER OF PV PANELS

To determine the optimal number of PV panels, we need to balance the system size with the available budget and energy needs:

*   Based on the feature-engineered data, a system size of around 31-35 panels would provide sufficient energy for the household's needs while staying within the budget.
*   This corresponds to an estimated annual production of approximately 4,867.31 kWh.

### COST SAVINGS AND PAYBACK PERIOD

Assuming an average electricity cost of $0.3100 per kWh and considering the additional charging load from the EV(s):

*   The estimated annual savings would be around $1,508.87.
*   Based on these estimates, the payback period for a 31-35 panel system would be approximately 9.84 years.

### RISKS AND CAVEATS

*   Sunlight variability and consumption growth may impact the system's performance and energy production.
*   Battery storage could be advisable to mitigate these risks and provide backup power during periods of low sunlight or high energy demand.

## RECOMMENDATION

Based on the analysis, we recommend installing a 31-35 panel PV system with an estimated annual production of approximately 4,867.31 kWh. This system should provide sufficient energy for the household's needs while staying within the budget and offering a payback period of around 9.84 years.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   Optimal number of PV panels: 31-35
*   Estimated annual production: 4,867.31 kWh
*   Cost savings: $1,508.87 per year
*   Payback period: approximately 9.84 years
*   Battery storage may be advisable to mitigate risks and provide backup power.
