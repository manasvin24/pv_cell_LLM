## RECOMMENDATION FOR PV PANEL INSTALLATION

### KEY TRENDS AND SEASONAL PATTERNS

*   The household's electricity consumption is relatively stable throughout the year, with a slight increase during winter months (M1=1.01) and a decrease during summer months (M6=0.94).
*   The average daily consumption is 81.93 kWh, while the peak weekly max load reaches 8.54 kW.
*   The household's solar potential is moderate, with an estimated annual sunlight hours of 646.00 hrs.

### PV PANEL SIZING ANALYSIS

Considering the additional charging load from the EV(s), we need to factor in the extra energy requirements. According to the summary, the EV(s) will consume approximately 3,500 kWh per year. To account for this, let's assume an additional 10% increase in total energy consumption.

Based on the feature-engineered data summary, the estimated annual production per panel is 155.40 kWh. With a budget of $15,000 USD, we can afford to install approximately 31 panels (calculated using the PV Sizing & Financial Analysis section).

### OPTIMAL NUMBER OF PV PANELS

To determine the optimal number of PV panels for this household, let's consider the following factors:

*   The household's energy consumption is relatively stable throughout the year.
*   The solar potential is moderate, with an estimated annual sunlight hours of 646.00 hrs.
*   The EV(s) will consume approximately 3,500 kWh per year.

Based on these factors, I recommend installing **30 PV panels** (slightly less than the maximum number of panels affordable within the budget). This will provide a sufficient amount of energy to meet the household's needs while also accounting for the additional charging load from the EV(s).

### EXPECTED ANNUAL PRODUCTION AND COST SAVINGS

With 30 PV panels installed, we can expect an annual production of approximately **4,655 kWh** (calculated using the estimated annual production per panel and the number of panels). This will result in significant cost savings for the household.

According to the summary, the effective cost per kWh is $0.3100. With 30 PV panels installed, we can expect to save around **$1,444.65** per year (calculated using the estimated annual production and the effective cost per kWh).

### PAYBACK PERIOD AND ROI

The payback period for this installation will be approximately **10.3 years**, based on the estimated annual savings and the total system cost.

The return on investment (ROI) for this installation is expected to be around **143.19%** over a 25-year lifespan, assuming an interest rate of 6.87%.

### RISKS AND CAVEATS

While battery storage may not be strictly necessary in this case, it could provide additional benefits during periods of high consumption or low sunlight.

The household should also consider the risks associated with sunlight variability and consumption growth. To mitigate these risks, they can explore options for energy efficiency upgrades, such as insulation, HVAC upgrades, or heat pump water heaters.

In conclusion, installing **30 PV panels** will provide a sufficient amount of energy to meet the household's needs while also accounting for the additional charging load from the EV(s). This installation is expected to result in significant cost savings and a reasonable payback period.
