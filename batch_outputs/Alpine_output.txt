## OPTIMAL PV PANEL RECOMMENDATION FOR THE HOUSEHOLD

### Task 1: Review of Feature-Engineered Data Summary and Knowledge Base Passages

The feature-engineered data summary provides a comprehensive overview of the household's electricity consumption, solar potential, and financial metrics. Key trends and seasonal patterns include:

*   **Annual Electricity Consumption:** 33,823.04 kWh
*   **Peak Weekly Max Load:** 8.96 kW
*   **95th-Percentile Weekly Avg Load:** 4.77 kW
*   **Seasonal Indices:** M1=1.01, M2=0.95, M3=0.90, M4=0.85, M5=0.87, M6=0.94, M7=1.10, M8=1.20, M9=1.16, M10=1.01, M11=0.97, M12=1.03

The knowledge base passages provide valuable insights into solar payback periods, financing options, and equipment costs.

### Task 2: Key Trends, Seasonal Patterns, and Anomalies

Based on the data summary:

*   **Annual Electricity Consumption:** The household consumes approximately 33,823 kWh per year.
*   **Peak Weekly Max Load:** The peak weekly max load is 8.96 kW, indicating a significant demand during certain periods.
*   **95th-Percentile Weekly Avg Load:** The 95th-percentile weekly avg load is 4.77 kW, highlighting the importance of considering high-demand periods when sizing PV panels.

### Task 3: EV Charging Load and Budget

The household owns one EV, which contributes an additional 3,500 kWh per year to their electricity consumption. Considering this increased demand:

*   **Total Annual kWh (house + EV):** 37,323.04 kWh
*   **PV Installation Budget:** $15,000 USD

### Task 4: Maximum Number of Panels Affordable Within the Budget

To determine the maximum number of panels affordable within the budget, we'll use the estimated annual production per panel:

*   **Est Annual Production / Panel:** 162.07 kWh
*   **Panels for 100% Offset:** 209 (based on total annual consumption)
*   **Maximum Number of Panels Within Budget:** Using the estimated cost per panel ($350) and the budget ($15,000), we can calculate the maximum number of panels: $15,000 / $350 ≈ 43 panels

However, considering the additional EV charging load and the household's energy needs, it is recommended to size the PV system for at least 70% offset.

### Task 5: Optimal Number of PV Panels

Based on the data summary and knowledge base passages:

*   **Panels for 70% Offset:** 147
*   **Optimal Number of PV Panels:** Considering the household's energy needs, EV charging load, and budget constraints, it is recommended to install at least 147 panels.

### Task 6: Cost Savings and Payback Period

Using the estimated annual production and cost savings:

*   **Annual Production (at budget):** 5,024.17 kWh
*   **Annual Savings (at budget):** $1,557.49
*   **Payback Period:** Approximately 9.53 years

### Task 7: Risks and Battery Storage Considerations

Considering the risks:

*   **Sunlight Variability:** The household's sunlight consistency is relatively low (CV = 0.3310), which may impact PV production.
*   **Consumption Growth:** The household's electricity consumption has been increasing over the years, which may lead to higher energy demands in the future.
*   **Grid Dependency:** The household's nighttime load ratio is high (63.17%), indicating a significant reliance on grid electricity during off-peak hours.

Battery storage may be advisable to mitigate these risks and ensure a stable energy supply.

## RECOMMENDATION

Based on the data summary, knowledge base passages, and calculations:

*   **Optimal Number of PV Panels:** 147
*   **Expected Annual Production:** 5,024.17 kWh
*   **Cost Savings:** $1,557.49 per year
*   **Payback Period:** Approximately 9.53 years
*   **ROI (25 yr):** 144.24%
*   **Battery Storage Recommendation:** Consider installing a battery storage system to mitigate risks and ensure a stable energy supply.

This recommendation is based on the household's specific energy needs, EV charging load, budget constraints, and risk factors.
