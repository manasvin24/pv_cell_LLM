## RECOMMENDATION FOR PV PANEL INSTALLATION

### KEY TRENDS AND SEASONAL PATTERNS

*   The household's annual electricity consumption is 39,524.53 kWh.
*   The average daily consumption is 108.29 kWh.
*   The peak weekly max load is 10.60 kW.
*   The winter/summer ratio of consumption is 0.92.

### PV PANEL SIZING

*   Considering the household's energy needs and budget, we will size the PV panels to meet at least 70% of their annual electricity consumption (39,524.53 kWh \* 0.7 = 27,568.38 kWh).
*   Based on the solar potential summary, the average weekly irradiance is 222.66 W/m².
*   The estimated daily peak sun hours are 1.78 hrs.
*   Using a PV panel efficiency of 18%, we can estimate the required panel size to meet the household's energy needs.

### OPTIMAL NUMBER OF PV PANELS

*   Based on the calculations, the optimal number of PV panels is 178 (panels for 70% offset).
*   This will provide an estimated annual production of 156.04 kWh/panel \* 178 panels = 27,768.72 kWh.
*   The excess energy produced can be fed back into the grid, reducing the household's electricity bills.

### COST SAVINGS AND PAYBACK PERIOD

*   With a budget of $15,000 USD for PV installation, the maximum number of panels affordable within this budget is 31 (max panels within budget).
*   The estimated annual production at this capacity is 4,837.24 kWh.
*   Based on the effective cost per kWh ($0.3100), the annual savings will be $1,499.54.
*   The payback period can be estimated as follows:

Payback Period = Total System Cost / Annual Savings
= $14,850 (at budget) / $1,499.54
≈ 9.90 years

### RISKS AND CAVEATS

*   Sunlight variability and consumption growth may impact the household's energy needs.
*   Battery storage is advisable to mitigate these risks and ensure a stable energy supply.

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

Based on the data summary and knowledge passages, we recommend installing 178 PV panels to meet at least 70% of the household's annual electricity consumption. This will provide an estimated annual production of 27,768.72 kWh, reducing their electricity bills by $1,499.54 per year. The payback period is approximately 9.90 years.

### KEY TAKEAWAYS

*   PV panel installation can significantly reduce the household's electricity bills.
*   A budget of $15,000 USD can affordably cover the cost of installing 178 PV panels.
*   Battery storage is advisable to mitigate risks associated with sunlight variability and consumption growth.
