## RECOMMENDATION FOR PV PANEL INSTALLATION

### KEY TRENDS AND SEASONAL PATTERNS

*   The household consumes approximately 27,584.90 kWh of electricity annually.
*   The average daily consumption is around 75.58 kWh.
*   The peak weekly max load is 7.62 kW, while the min weekly min load is 0.58 kW.
*   The seasonal indices show a slight increase in winter and summer months.

### PV PANEL SIZING ANALYSIS

*   Considering the household's energy consumption and solar potential, we can estimate the required number of panels to meet their needs.
*   Based on the feature-engineered summary, the estimated annual production per panel is 156.32 kWh.
*   To calculate the total number of panels needed, we divide the household's annual electricity consumption by the estimated annual production per panel:
    *   27,584.90 kWh (annual consumption) ÷ 156.32 kWh/panel = approximately 176.5 panels
*   However, since we cannot install a fraction of a panel, we round up to the nearest whole number: **177 panels**.

### BUDGET CONSTRAINTS

*   The household has a budget of $15,000 USD for PV installation.
*   Based on the knowledge base passages, the cost per panel is around $350.
*   To determine the maximum number of panels affordable within this budget, we divide the budget by the cost per panel:
    *   $15,000 ÷ $350/panel = approximately 42.86 panels
*   Since we cannot install a fraction of a panel, we round down to the nearest whole number: **42 panels**.

### OPTIMAL NUMBER OF PV PANELS

*   Considering both energy needs and budget constraints, we recommend installing **177 panels** (to meet their energy needs) but acknowledge that this exceeds the household's budget.
*   To balance these factors, we suggest installing **124 panels**, which is closer to the budget constraint while still providing a significant portion of the household's energy needs.

### EXPECTED ANNUAL PRODUCTION AND COST SAVINGS

*   Based on the estimated annual production per panel (156.32 kWh), we can calculate the expected annual production for 177 panels:
    *   177 panels \* 156.32 kWh/panel = approximately 27,623.04 kWh
*   This is close to their actual energy consumption, indicating that the recommended number of panels should meet their needs.
*   Assuming an average electricity cost of $0.31 per kWh (based on the effective cost per kWh), we can estimate the annual savings:
    *   27,584.90 kWh (annual consumption) \* $0.3100/kWh = approximately $8,551.32
*   With the recommended number of panels (177), they should produce around 27,623.04 kWh annually, resulting in an estimated annual savings of **$8,555.51**.

### PAYBACK PERIOD AND ROI

*   Based on the knowledge base passages, we can estimate the payback period and ROI:
    *   Payback Period: approximately 15.48 years (based on a $350/panel cost and $0.3100/kWh electricity cost)
    *   ROI (25-year lifespan): approximately 135.57%

### RISKS AND CAVEATS

*   The household should be aware of the risks associated with sunlight variability, consumption growth, and grid dependency.
*   Battery storage may be advisable to mitigate these risks and ensure a stable energy supply.

**RECOMMENDATION**

Based on the feature-engineered summary and knowledge base passages, we recommend installing **124 panels**, which balances the household's energy needs with their budget constraints. This should provide an estimated annual production of around 19,448.48 kWh, resulting in significant cost savings and a payback period of approximately 15.5 years.
