## RECOMMENDATION FOR PV PANEL INSTALLATION

### KEY TRENDS AND SEASONAL PATTERNS

*   The household's electricity consumption is relatively stable throughout the year, with a slight increase during winter months (Winter / Summer ratio: 0.92).
*   The average weekly load is around 4.22 kW, while the peak weekly max load reaches up to 9.55 kW.
*   The household has a moderate level of sunlight exposure, with an estimated annual sunlight hours of 649.70 hrs and an average weekly irradiance of 222.20 W/m².

### PV PANEL SIZING

Considering the additional charging load from the EV (3,500 kWh/yr), we need to ensure that the PV system can meet this increased demand.

*   The estimated annual production per panel is 155.72 kWh.
*   To offset 100% of the household's electricity consumption and account for the EV's charging needs, we would require **237 panels** ( Panels for 100% offset).
*   However, given the budget constraint of $15,000 USD, we can only afford to install a maximum of **31 panels** (Max panels within budget).

### OPTIMAL NUMBER OF PV PANELS

Based on the available data and considering the household's energy needs, I recommend installing **31 panels**, which should provide approximately 4,827.32 kWh/yr of electricity.

*   This number is constrained by the budget but should still allow for a significant reduction in the household's electricity bill.
*   The estimated annual savings with this installation would be around $1,496.47.

### COST SAVINGS AND PAYBACK PERIOD

With 31 panels installed, the total system cost (at budget) would be approximately $14,850 USD.

*   Based on the estimated annual production and savings, the payback period for this investment would be around **9.92 years**.
*   The Return on Investment (ROI) for this project is expected to be around 134.67% over a 25-year lifespan.

### RISKS AND CAVEATS

While battery storage is not explicitly recommended in this analysis, it may become more financially attractive as the current net billing rules are revised.

*   The household should consider factors like sunlight variability and consumption growth when evaluating the effectiveness of their PV system.
*   It's essential to monitor and adjust the system as needed to ensure optimal performance and maximize energy savings.

### FINAL RECOMMENDATION

Based on the provided data summary and knowledge base passages, I recommend installing **31 panels** within the household's budget of $15,000 USD. This should provide a significant reduction in electricity bills while also accounting for the additional EV charging load. The estimated annual production would be around 4,827.32 kWh/yr, with an expected payback period of approximately **9.92 years** and an ROI of 134.67% over a 25-year lifespan.

Please note that this analysis assumes no changes in electricity rates or consumption patterns. Regular monitoring and adjustments may be necessary to ensure the optimal performance of the PV system.
